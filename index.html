		<p>I'm Merlin and I'm all about data-based decision-making. I have conducted empirical, human-centered programming language usability research in general and polyglot programming research specifically. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in December 2019. I also just changed my last name to my wife's, so most stuff refers to my old name.</p>

		<h2 id="empirical">Research</h2>
		<p>My research focused on using human-centered, empirical methods. Meaning that I recruited programmers and sat them down in front of pre-prepared tasks in controlled environments to compare the outcomes. This all had the goal to make programming easier for programmers by improving programming language design and/or giving recommendations on how programming practice might be improved. This work is important because gathering data on how programming languages are used is still rare and the humans are vital to how software is developed. <a href="https://quorumlanguage.com/evidence.html" target="_blank">More info can be found here.</a></p>

		<p>As part of this research, and generally my work during my time at UNLV, I helped work on the <a href="https://quorumlanguage.com/" target="_blank">Quorum programming language</a> together with my great colleagues at the Software Engineering and Media Lab. Quorum is an evidence-based programming language. I recommend taking a look at the website. Most of my research was motivated to help make decisions to inform Quorum design.</p>

		<p>In my dissertation, I worked on researching polyglot programming. Or more specifically: I wondered what happens when developers switch between two programming languages in different contexts. I'll hold off on giving the details here until I can publish the results.</p>
